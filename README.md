# Concentration

Poker cards are laid face down, 4 rows, with 4 cards on each row. At every turn, the player flips over two poker cards. If it matches(same suit and rank), the cards are removed from the board.
If it doesn't, the cards are flipped back. And the next turn begins. The player has to clear the board within the time limit given.

After the 4 * 4 board, the next and last level is the 6 * 6, with a slightly longer time limit given.
